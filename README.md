TO DO:
- code cleanup
- migrate loop logic to relevant "classes"
- loop should just iterate over a single array of elements and trigger their update and draw methods
- modularize?
-
- enemies sometimes shoot
- players with no attacks?
- post-game cutscenes (hallway, medals)
- sliding touch?
- preload images
- password menu

GLITCHES:
- blinking enemies disappear on player death
